# Welcome to the iOS Developer Career Path

üëã Hey, I'm Ryan. Excited to delve into Swift iOS, building the tools I need for my journey toward becoming a skilled iOS developer.

# Introduction to Swift

[Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift) is a robust and intuitive general-purpose programming language crafted by Apple, with development commencing in July 2010.

Drawing inspiration from languages like Objective-C, Rust, Haskell, Ruby, Python, C#, and more, Swift boasts a concise yet expressive syntax, making it an ideal starting point for beginners and a seamless transition for experienced developers.

Released in 2014, Swift was designed for creating applications across various platforms:

- üì± iOS
- ‚åö watchOS
- üñ•Ô∏è macOS
- üì∫ tvOS
- üêß Linux

Since its inception, numerous companies, including Uber and Slack, have integrated Swift into their tech stacks.

Noteworthy adopters include:

1. **Apple:** Naturally, Apple employs Swift for iOS app development.
2. **Uber:** Swift plays a pivotal role in Uber's mobile app development.
3. **Airbnb:** The iOS app at Airbnb is crafted using Swift.
