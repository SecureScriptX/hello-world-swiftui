Write a Swift program called Initials.swift that displays the initials of your name in block letters.

// Fun Fact: I love practicing mandarin Chinese. Ni Hao!

let intials = """
  RRRR        SSS
  R    R     S   S
  R    R     S 
  RRRR        SSS
  R R            S
  R  R       S   S
  R   R       SSS
"""

print(intials)

OUTPUT:
  RRRR        SSS

  R    R     S 
  RRRR        SSS
